## My process
- First I build the mobile layout and then I build the desktop version
- I used flexbox for the layout
- To make the website responsive I used mediaquery

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned how to make an overlay to an background Image.  This is by far the most challenging thing in this project for a newbie.

### Continued development

I am still struglling to position a div and sometimes margin and padding also makes me confuse. To increase my skill I will build more projects to get a hang of these terms.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) - This helped me for  responsive design pattern and I  will use it going forward.
